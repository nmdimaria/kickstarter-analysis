# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Client Louise is launching a Kickstarter campaign for her prospective play production. Data analysis will help her determine the best way to set up her campaign to ensure the best chance of success.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This section broke down all theater campaigns by the month they were created.

There is a huge spike of campaigns at the beginning of summer. As the summer wains, the number of campaigns drops precipitously. This continues through December when there is essentially and equal chance that any given campaign will succeed or fail.

Campaigns launched in May seem to have the greatest rate of success. It also seems like more people launch campaigns in May which may skew the results. However, just on inspection there is a higher percentage of successful campaigns as well. This could perhaps be due to the fact that more people want to start fun activities at the beginning of summer and that more people are looking for things to do during the summer. Therefore there are more campaigns, but there are also more people excited to go out and see plays. Perhaps some of the plays are for kids as well and backers want to support summer activities for children.

Whatever the reason may be the earlier in the summer you start your kickstarter campaign the more likely it will succeed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This section broke down all play productions by their fundraising goals.

Campaigns with lower fundraising goals seemed to have a higher rate of success. There is a spike between $35,000 and $45,000. However, the number of campaigns in higher budget numbers drops off quite dramatically after the $10,000 mark. I would say the sample size beyond $15,000 is pretty unreliable.

In my view, the main takeaway here is that plays that are funded through Kickstarter campaigns are generally lower budget productions. Once the budget gets to a certain point, I'm sure doners begin to question why that play is not a professionally produced production. And if the budget is that high, most creators would probably be more likely to produce their play in a more professional setting. Some information on the number of backers per successful campaign would be an interesting way to dig deeper into this.

Having said that, it is very important to keep the budget of your production as low as possible; or at least the amount you want to raise on Kickstarter.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I actually was working through the module and got through most of it when I copy/pasted something wrong and messed up the original data set and couldn't reset it. I ended up just starting this Challenge in a new, fresh copy of the data so I hope that is ok! I actually might save a raw copy of the data in the future because I can imagine that you don't always have access to the original data file and it would be quite alarming to delete something and not be able to get it back.

I also learned a lot about organizing and formatting the Pivotcharts that a did not know before. One of the challenging portions for me was moving the labels for the row and collumn headers. That took a little bit of hunting around.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. More campaigns are started at the beginning of summer.
2. The earlier in the summer you start your campaign, the more likely it will succeed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. Most campaigns have low budgets.
2. The lower your campaign goal amount, the more likely it will succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It might be interesting to know some more things about the content of the campaigns themselves. For example: which campaigns had video or photo content and how much, how many comments were left on each page. It would also be interesting to know how the owners of the campaigns promoted their works. Did they share their campaigns on social media and how much? How many followers do they have? How many other people shared their campaigns?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I would love to see a breakdown on the number of backers in successful campaings.
